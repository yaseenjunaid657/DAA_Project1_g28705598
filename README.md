# DAA_Project1_g28705598

This repository contains the code and report for analyzing a nested-loop algorithm with runtime $(\log\log n)^2$. It implements the assignment’s exact updates—outer loop $j \leftarrow 1.2j$, inner loop $k \leftarrow k^{1.5}$—and includes a small harness to measure median runtimes across input sizes, scale theory with a single factor $\alpha$, and plot measured vs. predicted performance. Run `python run_experiments.py` to reproduce the tables and figure.
